# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration XX

* Start date: October 10, 2017
* End date: October 12, 2017

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

We decided to have in person meeting on every Tuesday at GB and Friday or Sunday afternoon on Skype or in Person. We will have planning meeting on Tuesday, and the purpose of this meeting is to decide what should be done for next meeting and how the task will be divided. The purpose of Friday or Sunday meeting is to mainly combine what each person did since the last meeting and discuss about any change that should be made, and also make sure that the progress speed will be able to meet the deadlines. We might schedule more meetings for codings and debugging (e.g., how a feature should be implemented and what API should be used)

#### Artifacts

We will make a list of all features (in point form) that will be implemented for the project. We will evaluate the length for the features and divide the tasks between the members based on the evaluated time needed for the features. We will prioritize tasks that we consider to be fundamental for the functioning of the application, and the most important features such as streaming room functionalities and the ability for searching for available streaming videos. Extra features such as special effects when clicking the app or some fancy functionalities will be considered lastly.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

* Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
* Order the items from most to least important.
* Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

For this iteration, we will be designing and building front end of our app and also a basic working connection that allows streamer and viewer to chat.

List of tasks:



#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

* Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
* Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
* Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
