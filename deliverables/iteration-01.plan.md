# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 01

* Start date: October 10, 2017
* End date: October 12, 2017

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

Everyone in the team be coding, making sure that each person's own part is finished upon the deadline, and also supervise other members. For better managing the team, we will be assigning specific roles for the scrum process.

**Team lead (scrum master):** This is the project leader and is responsible for managing the team, obtaining resources for it (communicate with TAs, instructors and coding experts to get suggestions). Team lead will make sure that the entire project is well planned, scheduled, discussion are set up when needed and communicate with each of the members if needed.

**Team member:** Each of us will be team member and will be contributing to the implementations of the project, planning and review of the project, testing the codes and debugging the codes.

**Product manager:** Will be managing and deciding tasks to be implemented for the iteration and makes sure that the features are implemented. Also responsible for prioritize tasks in the item list and makes decision on any changes of tasks to be done. (e.g, when the project is to hard to be implemented or an iteration has too many features, the product manager will be responsible for quickly decide whether to cut the features or not)

**Domain expert (Android, java):** The domain expert will be responsible for providing technical advice and support to each team member and make suggestions on how the project will be implemented.

**Front end developer:** Will be responsible for the front end design and make UI designs for the app.

**Backend developer:** Will be responsible for database coding, system server connection, interactive features implementations. 

#### Events

We decided to have in person meeting on every Tuesday at GB and Friday or Sunday afternoon on Skype or in Person. We will have planning meeting on Tuesday, and the purpose of this meeting is to decide what should be done for next meeting and how the task will be divided. The purpose of Friday or Sunday meeting is to mainly combine what each person did since the last meeting and discuss about any change that should be made, and also make sure that the progress speed will be able to meet the deadlines. We might schedule more meetings for codings and debugging (e.g., how a feature should be implemented and what API should be used)

#### Artifacts

How do you keep track of what needs to get done?

We will make a list of all tasks (in point form) that will be implemented for the project. Cross out the task when it is done.

How do tasks get assigned to team members? 

We will evaluate the length for the features and divide the tasks between the members based on the evaluated time needed for the features.

How do you prioritize tasks?

We will prioritize tasks that we consider to be fundamental for the functioning of the application, and the most important features such as streaming room functionalities and the ability for searching for available streaming videos. Extra features such as special effects when clicking the app or some fancy functionalities will be considered lastly.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

**Goals:** 

- Propose an idea for the project.
- Finish researching the problems and refining the idea for the project
- Make visual designs if necessary to present the project idea.
- Research and decide the language that will be used for the implementation (e.g, java, html or C)

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

* Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.

* Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)

* Be concise, yet precise. 
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

   â€‹

   We will produce design images to present the idea. (for each page of the page, make a front end design and put elements (data) in it to illustrate how the app works). This is on our to-do list because it's simple yet easy to view what we have come up with so far. For example, using images of the front end (with elements) instead of actual code, we will be able to clearly display key parts (such as button functionality and UI design).
