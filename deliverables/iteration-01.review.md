# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 > ​     
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

* When: October 13th
* Where: Bahen

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


1.	Moving from android development to java development
•	Not everyone in our group was familiar with android development. By transition our product from and android application to a java desktop application we eliminated the need to do extra research on android development.d

2.	Having small 15-20 minute meetings
•	15-20 minute meeting made sure every member brought up critical points/developments during their speaking time. With a group of 6 students working on a large project, it is critical that everyone uses their speaking time during meetings efficiently.

3.	Using tutorial time as a meeting
•	Using tutorial time as a meeting was valuable because it’s a time slot where we’re guaranteed to have every group member available. With a group of 6 students, it’s tough finding a time slot where everyone is available so using tutorials for meetings was very helpful

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

1.	Having our main form of communication be through Facebook chat.
•	We’ve learned that using Facebook chat isn’t the best way to communicate with each other because we aren’t checking the chat on a consistent basis. Also, hearing someone talk versus reading someone’s message is a better way to communicate between one another.
2.	Having meetings every day.
•	We’ve learned that having meeting after every day leads to redundancy. Most things that were brought up the day before were brought up again.


#### Planned changes

1.	Using Skype as a main form of communication versus Facebook chat
•	Using Skype voice chat versus Facebook text chat allows us to keep track of who’s present. Communicating ideas or developments is also more efficient with voice chat rather than text chat.
2.	Having meetings 2 to 3 times a week versus everyday
•	This allows members 2 to 3 days to work on developments rather than 1 day. Gives members the ability to make major developments versus minor ones.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* From most to least important.
* Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
* If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

-The idea for creating a Java based peer-to-peer tutoring application has been presented to all team members, and the high level design and implementation of the application has been agreed upon as well.

-We have agreed upon the use of Java for the design of this application after consulting with all team members after taking into account both the user experience as well as the difficulty of implementing certain features. 

-We have created diagrams to illustrate our idea on how the final product should look like to the end user, as well as highlighting specific aspects of the application that will be major components to our work within upcoming sprints.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* From most to least important.
* For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
   
-Researching and refining our design is partially completed as of now. This is something that we have considered as a constant factor to our design process. Within the scope of this project, we have completed informal research on potential competitor software to see what we can do differently to create value within the market. It is possible that we can do further research upon our target user group and refine our design as needed. 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* 2 - 4 items
* Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
* High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
* These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
* Can be related to product and/or process.

 - Chatroom: We are planning to make it real-time. In order to accomplish this task easily, we can use google firebase (real-time database).
 - Pre-Chatroom interface: We will make a list of some sort that keeps track of all available chatrooms (empty or full), and will add distinctions to chatrooms that are created by instructors and students. We will also add a capacity to each chatroom.
